vZome Viewer using Google Cardboard
================

vZome Viewer is a virtual reality application for viewing 3D models built using vZome.
The vZome model files must be stored in a Dropbox account, since a Dropbox chooser is
used to select the model to view.

Viewing is in stereo VR, and requires a VR headset like Google Cardboard for a good
viewing experience.

The code is based on the Google Cardboard "treasure hunt" sample.
